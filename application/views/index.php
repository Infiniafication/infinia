					<h1>Hi, let me introduce myself.</h1>
					<div class="darker">
						<p>
							My name is <strong>Isaac Yong</strong> (Infiniafication or Infinia) and I am from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/JQOAO" target="_blank">Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia</a>. <br /> 
							I'm currently <?=date('Y')-1993?> years old and I'm currently awaiting my graduation in October 2015 for my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at <a href="http://www.swinburne.edu.my/" target="_blank">Swinburne University of Technology, Sarawak Campus</a>.

						<h2 class="fyp">Final Year Project</h2>
						<p>
							I worked in a team of four for my <strong>Final Year Project</strong> entitled "Smart Home" which scored a <strong>High Distinction</strong> (HD; 85% and above). I was assigned as the project team leader who was responsible for planning and making sure the project ran smoothly. Besides that, I was the lead Frontend Developer and was in charge of <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> and the <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> for the <strong>mobile</strong> web application which you may see a <a href="<?=site_url('../smarthome/index.php')?>" target="_blank"><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" role="button">sample here</button></a> (password field filled intentionally). My team made sure that it performs well on mobile devices, give it a try! <br />
							You may read the <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> document which I wrote <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12JrqnLg8J0f-RMMSFJLS7vkrXYk2wt93tGsVchMqEyo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.
							You may see the coding repository <a href="https://bitbucket.org/epic-org/smart-home-web-app">here</a>. <br />

					<h2>What I can do</h2>
					<h3>Code. <br /><small>Whether it's coding a website or coding algorithms, I'm up to the task. I take coding for efficiency and coding with standards very seriously.</small></h3>
					<h3>Design. <br /><small>From the layout of an entire page to details as fine as single pixels, I carry with me the trait that the average programmer doesn't: <strong>Creativity</strong>.</small></h3>
					<h3>Present. <br /><small>I love presentations &#8212; especially the more spontaneous ones. Among my peers, I am considered to be one of the best presenters.</small></h3>
					<h3>Analyze. <br /><small>No matter what I'm doing, I'm always analyzing. Analyzing interfaces, codes and game balance is a thing I do daily.</small></h3>

						<h2>I know what makes or breaks a game</h2>
						<p>
							I take a huge interest in game mechanics and game balance. <br />
							I can differentiate a healthy mechanic from a bad one. <br />
						</p>
						<p>
							For example, I know what makes a good/balanced Assassin-like character <br />(this example applies especially to competitive online games). <br />
							A good Assassin character will perform assassinations which his opponents can have some sort of counter-play to them; his opponents can react to his assassinations. This most likely means that his assassinations will be (but is not limited to just be) telegraphed. <br />
							Contrarily, a bad Assassin character would be the total opposite - he is able to assassinate his opponents without them being able to do anything much about it. Some examples of bad Assassins would be those who can "one-shot", have extremely high mobility (which makes it very difficult for opponents to "catch" them), and/or have no telegraphs when performing an assassination. <br />

					<h2>And what do I want to do?</h2>
					<p>
						I want to live my life doing something that I love doing, everyday. On top of that, I want to be able to grow in a friendly and motivating environment.
						My true aspiration is to be able to design and develop games as well as to keep game balance (and mechanics) in check.
						Besides that, I dream that someday, I will be able to successfully flesh the idea of a game that I've had (and have been continuously working on) for a long time.

					<h2>So, what else do I do?</h2>
					<p>
						I love playing computer games and I play them a lot. I've been playing computer games since I was 11. I am a huge fan of competitive gaming but currently play games more casually than competitively. <br />
						I currently mainly play League of Legends, Hearthstone, Guild Wars 2 and Battlefield 4. <br />
						Just to name some of many other games I've played: GunZ: The Duel, Granado Espada (or Sword of the New World), Assassin's Creed series, Counter-Strike series, Battlefield series, O2Jam/Mania, Super Dancer Online, The Sims series.

						<h2>Who is that in the background?</h2>
						<p>
							That's my drawing of Ciel Phantomhive from the anime Black Butler (<span lang="ja">黒執事</span> or Kuroshitsuji). It's my first time drawing a character (doesn't look too good but I'd rather this than get sued for using someone else's work :P)! <br />
							He's one of my favourite characters thus far in all of the movies and anime that I've watched. He is determined and makes a firm stand on what he believes in. He bears a tainted path and a scarred life (some would call it cursed) but accepts his fate and continues to move forward. Despite it all, he still has a kind heart for others and wishes for them to not be involved with him too much because of the darkness that he may bring upon them. <br />
