					<h1>UDK Sample <small>The Caretaker</small></h1>
					<hr>
					<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
					<p>
						Please take note that this sample does not entirely represent my sense of game balance, mechanics, story, ideas, concepts.
						This sample was done with a very packed timeframe (while I was busy with <abbr title="Final Year Project">FYP</abbr>).
						The purpose of this sample was more inclined towards learning UDK and testing out different things. It is far from representing a proper concept.
						<br />
						<strong>TL;DR: Please don't judge my best ability based on this sample. It was done to learn and test UDK.</strong>
						Also, I do not own any assets used in the game!
					</p>
					<p>
						For drafts of some of my concepts and ideas, please take a look <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/q6s49e8y1jlo34c/AAA0Zel0QOPvI7gGLqqKCdCja?dl=0">here</a>. The ideas can still be expanded further and are not final.
					</p>
					<h2>Instructions</h2>
					<p>
						Due to the fact that the game was not done to perfection and that I did not have Scaleform GFx to create the Menu and User Interface, the following instructions are provided.
						<ol class="my-list">
							<li>After running the game, you will be brought to the UDK default menu. Select "Instant Action" then "Start Game" (please do not alter the game settings).</li>
							<li>To spawn, press the "Right Mouse Button" (the Left Mouse Button is binded to the torchlight).</li>
							<li>Please pay attention to the in-game announcements as well (in case you missed it, "E" to interact with objects).</li>
						</ol>
